Introduction to Data Science Project #1 and Project #2

#Project 1 Perform Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) on Customer Churn data within the Telecommunication 
           industry. The analysis of the data should focus on predicting customer churn rate. 
#Project 2 Build Machine Learning models to predict whether a customer will churn or not. 
           Perform two stages of analysis, based on different distribution of data: 
           1) Fit your models on the original dataset 
           2) Fit your models on the modified dataset, after applying the SMOTE technique.
